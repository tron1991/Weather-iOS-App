## What is it?

###Main Weather View Controller
This view will show the main weather of the day followed by a forecast for 5 days in the future. We will use the Open Weather API to connect with the stats in realtime with the ability to refresh with a button on the upper right side. Animations will be completed using the Spring Framework.

Data to be Shown
•	Current Date
•	5 day forecast
•	Current Weather in Celsius
•	Weather Description

###WatchOS View Controller
The main view will display the current weather, weather icon, current time and date, temperature in Celsius, and weather description.

###Email Notifications
Users receive no email notifications in this iOS Client.

###Registration
No registration required to use the app. However, to be able to like and reply to comments will require a login.
